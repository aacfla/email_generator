Tool to generate images and HTML for weekly AACF Bodylife Emails

## Background
The weekly Bodylife emails serve to provide information about what is going on in AACF. In the
past, Bodylife emails simply consisted of plain text, but in the 2016-2017 school year, emails were
changed to use HTML instead. The HTML not only allowed information to be presented in a more
appealing format but also enhanced the viewing experience on mobile devices. In order to make the
emails appear consist between viewing devices, information is presented in static images instead of
plain text. However, the emails represent a significant burden on the Bodylife coordinators since
they must manually create and upload images and edit the HTML email.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to alleviate the burden of generating Bodylife emails by providing a
user-friendly interface for editing information and generating images and HTML.

## TODO
- Finalize Design
